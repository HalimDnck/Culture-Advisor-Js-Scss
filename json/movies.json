      "text": "Arthur Fleck, a clown and aspiring stand-up comedian, lives with his mother, Penny, in crime-ridden�Gotham City. Arthur suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to have random, uncontrollable laughing fits, requiring medication for which he depends on social services. After Arthur is attacked by juvenile delinquents, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver for self-defense. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club. Arthur is fired from his job at a children's hospital when he accidentally exposes the gun despite his explanation that it was given to him by Randall, who denies this. While riding home on the subway still wearing his clown makeup, Arthur is mocked and beaten by drunk businessmen from Wayne Investments; he fatally shoots two of them in self-defense and murders the third as he attempts to flee. The killings are condemned by their employer, billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne. Protesters begin donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Budget cuts shut down the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication.",
      "review1": "Not only an intelligent throwback to the feel-bad shock cinema of the 1970s, Joker is all but unique in its social realism...",
      "review2": "The result of these creative decisions, however, is that whatever power Joker, as a pop culture icon, might wield, Joker, as a movie, feels toothless.",
      "review3": "Joker is a jumble - sometimes brilliant and sometimes trite. Among its flashes of excellence is a self-serious movie that isn't nearly as deep as it thinks it is.",

      "review1": "This movie is a masterpiece. That term gets thrown around a lot -- it's a very easy thing to say about great films like this -- but this movie is one of the best.",

The agent considers his mission a failure because the \"Fizzle Bomber,\" the unidentified serial-bombing fugitive he confronted, remains at large and will carry out his bombing on another day, ultimately killing over ten thousand.",
